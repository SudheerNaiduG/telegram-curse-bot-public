# telegram-curse-bot-public

This bot is just for fun.
Just deploy this bot in heroku or any other server or you can just run it in your cmd or colab.
The script should be running for the bot to work.

## Evil-insult
For this bot,I used [Evil-insult-generator](https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=text) for the random curses.
PS: **The curses maybe offensive.**

## Process

Create a bot in bot father in telegram and copy the token and paste it in the [code](https://github.com/th0ma5s5helby/telegram-curse-bot-public/blob/master/main.py) in line 17.
Voila..run the code and you have your cursing bot up and running.
Use the command `/curser` in the bot and it will reply a random curse

## Note
If you are running it in your cmd or colab you have to install the `python-telegram-bot` module
You can install this by using \n `pip3 install python-telegram-bot`
